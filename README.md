# PixelFetcher - a new start

This has the ImageLoader (legacy, from maven central) as a dependency. This is a just a wrapper around that library.

- Ensure no regressions
- Integrate all changes from projects using the forks
- Get rid of that dependency by extracting, while refactoring/refining, the needed classes
- Onwards!
